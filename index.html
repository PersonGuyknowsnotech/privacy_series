  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="number1">
   <p>Today, in every bit of a second there are millions of data flowing through the internet. 
These data are going through an encrypted tunnel called a Secure Socket Layer or SSL 
to prevent anyone except the user from viewing sensitive data that should not be shared. 
However, before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)">NSA leak</a> in 2013, the US National Security Agency, the NSA, began 
collecting as much data as possible. These information coming from people around the
 internet are kept in their secret database for them for well, National Security reasons. 
According to Snowden, The NSA made programs to gather and collect data from various
     tech companies like Microsoft and Google.</p>

  <h2>My Shocking Research</h2>
    <div class="number2">
     <p>And with months of research on privacy, I have discovered so many things about
the internet that I made a sketch. In the image below is what you will be seeing is 
how your data will be collected through the existing services and sites on the cloud
or the internet itself.  Privacy is a big deal specially online. Trackers and cookies that
build a profile on you and monitors your activity is a thing that must be prohibited.
As services promise to protect your data, agencies can still exploit and solicit data
from them. According to the Guardian, they usually delete data within a month or
       a year.</p>

  <br>
      <div class="number3">
        <p>As you can see here, your searches, photos, online messages, social profiles, GPS 
location and banking details are entering a gateway to the internet. These gateways
can either be a cell tower, your modem, or a satellite as a source of internet gates.
As your data pass through servers, monitoring of them and reporting abuse and 
malicious activity to the Local/Country Government is a must to them. Next, they flow
and enter the wide cloud, the internet. As they pass through there, information is 
collected by various website and services. Then the NSA and FBI kicks in to gather
data for their searching for their wanted person or to stop a terrorist attack.
Some flow to companies and uses it to accompany users’ experience in the web
with their creepy ads that follow you on the web. Plus hackers can also find a 
vulnerability on cloud or the servers themselves and exploit the data for themselves.
VPN’s are a great way to protect online privacy and hides IP addresses so that people
can access censored content. It makes an encrypted tunnel for flowing data to pass through
with security. It can be used as additional security along with TOR.</p>

  <h2>How the Web Spies on People</h2>
        <div class="number4">
          <p>Have you ever heard of cookies, adware, trackers, and any types of web spies
that hook up to you and monitor your browsing behavior. These things can be
prevented, but only some people, know about this and its 
consciousness has becoming more widespread. According to this data I found
on the Internet, this is the rate of Internet users who are more paranoid of
their data than those who accept everything the web has to offer to them.
This are the web-sourced ways the web spies on you.</p>

  <h2>Is there a Cure?</h2> 
          <div class="number5">
           <p>For now, there are alternative programs and Operating Systems to tech
services like Google and Microsoft. But privacy issues are still growing
and there are not enough alternative programs to beat those big tech
companies. Despite of the negativity in privacy-oriented software, there
are preventative measures and things you can do to enhance your privacy
             online and offline.</p>

  <h2>My Thoughts on the Internet Data Flow</h2>
            <div class="number6">
             <p>The Internet cloud is not the final destination of your data. It is going
through servers and databases of Security agencies, and Ad companies
collects and view data, for security purposes and for business.
Privacy is disappearing slowly and not many people are conscious about
              it, so people do not care.</p>
            </div>

  <br>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="number7">
              <p>So in conclusion, everything that you do in the internet is monitored by
several government agencies around the world. While there are some
alternatives you can use, there are low-cost and free tips to enhance
your privacy without having to suffer with gathering so many resources.
YOU ARE BEING WATCHED BY BIG BROTHER, and there is something people
can do about it, but while privacy is growing, inconvenience is also rising
because it is not an easy way to be anonymous online.</p>
