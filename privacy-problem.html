  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="things">
   <p>As everyone knows, privacy has been nowhere now. Most average
people don't even know what a VPN is, does not browse with
protection, searches without knowing that services use their information
to target them with ads and trackers to monitor everything they do.
Here is why Privacy is the greatest technical problem and one of the
Global problems in the digital age.</p>
  </div>

<h2>Reasons why privacy is a global problem<h2>
<br>
  <h2>Being too open</h2>
    <div class="things">
     <p>Today, we are innocently giving away a lot of information in searching
online, and browsing through social networks. I admit myself, giving
away personal information before I got knowledge on Information
Technology. I shared a lot in Facebook posts, entered about a million+
queries in google search since 2012 to 2018. There is a lot of alternatives
to these services, but not enough people are aware of these, and maybe
just stick to data collecting services, and just trust them with their information
despite past breaches, other services experienced.</p>

  <br>
  <h2>Refusal of Privacy</h2>
      <div class="things">
        <p>A lot of people do not want to use alternatives to data collecting software.
DuckDuckGo, Startpage.com, Gibiru, Mojeek, and many more are good 
examples of private alternatives to Google search. But many still wants google
because it is at the top of giving good results. Signal, Viber, Telegram, Wire
are also good, but they choose Messenger, and Facebook for social network just
because they are popular. So, they stick to popular platforms for technology
and refuse to use some of the alternatives because they can’t beat the popular tech.</p>

<br>
  <h2>Can’t just make them switch</h2>
        <div class="things">
          <p>Of course, you can’t force someone to join the privacy side, they will just ignore
it. But they will soon understand why you are asking them to go to privacy. I
myself, try to convince my friends and conducted research to prove them that
they need to protect their privacy. So after educating them though our free time
during online classes, they eventually gave their answers on if they trust Google
and Facebook. And yes, they said NO.</p>

  <h2>Previous Scandals</h2>
            <div class="things">
             <p>According to news websites and other tech sites, Facebook had been caught 
collecting personal information and on behalf of the trump campaign in 2016.
Their Cambridge Analytica scandal had made a change on all Americans’ view of
privacy. Also They, and Google was recently caught in a monopoly of exchanging 
information and too target ads to target users. These scandals is why I have made 
PersonGuyknowsnotech websites, entirely of HTML and CSS, and currently improving.
My websites really focus more on privacy and technology sometimes. I am a privacy
Advocate, and my articles could bring life to people to change their perspective on tech,
and change to the private side.</p>

  <h2>Snowden Revelations</h2>
            <div class="things">
              <p>This is probably the most reason why many are using Duckduckgo, Signal, TOR, Protonmail,
and many more. Because of this, we have not let tech take over us and let the NSA track
and spy on us whenever they want and however they want. The internet is not meant for
collecting data and making money out of people’s lives. The internet is meant to share
information and not to collect them.

            <br>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <div class="things">
              <p>Everything that we do and every information that we give, it is monitored. Privacy has become
a global problem, and not enough are able to fix it. That is why, Be  a privacy advocate, support
the protection of everyone’s privacy, do not let anyone manipulate your data, control it. So many
people are looking for privacy advocate, some may think they are crazy, but hear me out, these
ones have contributed to protection of privacy as how Snowden became heroic. So, in conclusion
in a nutshell, Privacy is a problem and we are the solution. </p>
