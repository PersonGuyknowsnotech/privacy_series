    Account Security
  </div>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="number">
   <p>Passwords, People have it, they forgot it, and they exploit it.
Passwords have become a popular and common way to secure
accounts, text, files, cars, tech, and even houses and buildings.
But there are ways accounts can be hacked and be used for malicious
activities. There are also ways to stop that from happening and keep
protected belongings safer.</p>
  </div>

<h2>Ways cybercriminals infiltrate your credentials<h2>
<br>
  <h2>Hacking-Brute Force</h2>
    <div class="things">
     <p>Brute force, one of the two ways hackers steal passwords and is used
until now. The process of this is by getting the security key if a hacker
knows the account administrator username, then using a terminal, ex.
Kali Linux Terminal, they enter a wordlist  and enters the username and 
completes the process by giving any possible passwords in the username
within the wordlist. This is probably a very dangerous method to use.However
This method only works for non-complexed, long passwords used. The
8-16 characters is enough to beat brute force attacks.</p>

  <br>
  <h2>Hacking-Dictionary Method</h2>
      <div class="things">
        <p>This the most common method hackers use, They use any password possible
related to the account without a network sniffer or any code. If they think the
target does not keep passwords complex, they can use a dictionary of common 
passwords, typically using the list of breached accounts and passwords. Once a 
server is attacked, other hackers can find targets  and their passwords. Any
passwords is vulnerable to this attack, as long as they find it at a breach attack.</p>

<br>
  <h2>Phishing</h2>
        <div class="things">
          <p>This method works by creating a fake login page for a service, or making a fake 
service of their own. When a victim uses a password to the fake login page, the
other end can steal it right away. Other ways includes the fake bank calls and 
the victims end up giving away their banking credentials, these fake calls can be
used on everyone, so as fake messages or spam emails. Any password is vulnerable
to Phishing attacks, but prevention is present.</p>

  <h2>Is there a Cure?</h2> 
          <div class="things">
           <p>For now, there are alternative programs and Operating Systems to tech
services like Google and Microsoft. But privacy issues are still growing
and there are not enough alternative programs to beat those big tech
companies. Despite of the negativity in privacy-oriented software, there
are preventative measures and things you can do to enhance your privacy
             online and offline.</p>

  <br>
  <h2>Hash-Cracking</h2>
            <div class="things">
             <p>It is same as the dictionary method, except it exploits the security key from the website
itself. When the hacker sees the breached account but the password is in md5 hash, the
cybercriminals use a tool called a rainbow table. It has a dictionary full of hashes and the 
plain text form, it can also transform hashes to text or find a match in the table. It is very
dangerous as plain text passwords with no numbers and symbols can be hacked easily using
this method.</p>

  <br>
  <h2>Others</h2>
            <div class="things">
              <p>Other exploitation techniques involve the use of powerful machines and powerful skills.
Some include tapping into the victim’s device itself, or wire-tapping as in finding exploits
in the actual telephone wire or the tunnel of wireless communication.</p>

            <h2>How to stop it?</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>Stronger Passwords<h2>
            <div class="things">
              <p>Making passwords very strong is a necessity for all accounts. Be it a Social Security Password
Bank pin codes, Lock Screen Passcodes, House pins and many more, it needs a super secure
and strong password. The needed password should be long enough to surpass brute force
attacks, Unique enough to be not found in a password dictionary, and secure enough to be
found in a hash decoder or the rainbow table. Strong passwords example is a 8-16 character
with Alphanumeric and symbols in it. For example, [<sUp3rStr0Ng(P@$$w0rd)>] and not
just “password” or any passwords you see from the internet, it is easy to find.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>2-factor authentication</h2>
            <div class="things">
              <p>2FA is an added security to your password used for your account. It can be sent to you via SMS, or
Emailed to you. 2FA can take the form of a code, button to verify, or an autofill number/text.
It applies to accounts that are used in Email, Social Network, SSS, Bank accounts, and more. This
kind of security will be a second step so that when a hacker finds a way to get the password, they
won’t be able to pass 2FA since it is a unique code sent only to the user and the user itself.</p>
            </div>

<br> 
<h2>Password Managers</h2>
<div class="things">
              <p>Programs such as Google password manager, Brave password manager, Lastpass, 1password,
and others are a secure way to keep passwords safe without forgetting any password for any 
accounts. However these software can be vulnerable to attacks since passwords they manage
are stored in the cloud. But not all, some store from the device local storage to prevent such
events of server attacks. Privacy could also be at risk for the same reason, some password
managers store passwords at the cloud. But overall, they can be trusted with user credentials.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Web protection, antivirus software</h2>
          <div class="things">
              <p>Web protection can help people to prevent phishing attacks and malicious sites. Antivirus
software scans for Viruses, Malware, Spyware, and hacking attempts to prevent data loss
and protect sensitive credentials. Their job is to protect accounts and computers as fast
as possible without showing inconvenience to users. As much as possible, these tools catch
any malicious software that are attempting to attack its victim.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <div class="things">
              <p>In conclusion, with every security, there is a vulnerability. No one can stop them, not even 
the government itself. So an advice to people is to be privacy-minded and trust no one with
credentials that can be used against them. Security and privacy are two things that will never
end, but so as exploiting and hacking. There are a variety of people that can hack, Governments
for national security, hackers for their own benefit, white hats for security study and powerful
brains for cyber research. Normal people cannot stop them but can prevent them from doing so.
So with every problem, comes with not only one but two, it's Solution and prevention. </p>
